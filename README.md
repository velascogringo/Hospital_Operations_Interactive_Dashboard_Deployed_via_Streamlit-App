## About
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a Hospital Operations Analytics Dashboard application. The application is designed to provide insights and visualizations for hospital operations data, allowing users to analyze performance metrics, patient trends, financial data, and more.

## Introduction
The Hospital Operations Dashboard Analytics application aims to help healthcare administrators and professionals make data-driven decisions by providing a comprehensive overview of hospital operations. With interactive dashboards and visualizations, users can explore key metrics, identify patterns, and uncover actionable insights to optimize hospital performance and patient care.

Note: The dataset used in this application is synthetic, meaning it has been artificially generated for demonstration and educational purposes. It does not represent actual hospital operations data.

## Features
- Performance Metrics Analysis: Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as patient admissions, bed occupancy rates, and emergency room wait times.

- Patient Trends Exploration: Analyze patient demographics, admission types, and length of stay to understand patient populations and utilization patterns.

- Financial Data Visualization: Visualize revenue streams, billing trends, and payer mix to monitor financial performance and optimize revenue cycles.

- Operational Efficiency Insights: Identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and resource utilization patterns to streamline hospital operations and improve overall efficiency.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Programming language used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

- Streamlit: Web application framework used for building interactive data dashboards.

- Pandas: Data manipulation library used for data preprocessing and analysis.

- NumPy: Library used for numerical computing and array operations.

- Matplotlib: Visualization library used for creating static plots and charts.

- Seaborn: Statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, used for creating more visually appealing plots.

- Plotly: Interactive visualization library used for creating interactive plots and dashboards.
